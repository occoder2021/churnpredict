# churnpredict
About the Data / Problem
This dataset and task can be found on Kaggle. The overarching task here is to 'create a Machine Learning Model to identify patterns of customer behavior and make predictions about upcoming churn rates. This task translates well to a binary classification problem. More specifically, a artificial convolutional neural network (ANN) will be used to analyze existing customer data, such as credit score and estimated salary etc and prdict if a customer will stay or leave the bank.

The dataset consists of 10,000 customer records of an anonymous bank.
